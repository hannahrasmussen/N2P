    "2. Download \\<file name\\> from my GitHub page at https://github.com/hannahrasmussen/N2P and put it in the folder within the folder.\n",
    "3. In the folder (not the folder within the folder), put a ``setup.py`` folder with the following code:\n",

    "5. Once you’re there, type and enter ‘pip install -e .’ (including the period). That ‘-e’ extension means that updates you make to the code are automatically also installed, which is obviously what we want.\n",
    "6. Now, to see if it worked, restart your jupyter notebook kernel and try and do ‘from N2P import N2P_calc’. If there are no errors, you can delete that line and should be good to run the code as is."
